# Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

Fix a broken version of a responsive website in this project!

Welcome to my project repository where I've taken on the challenge of repairing a malfunctioning responsive website named "Fotomatic". Throughout this project, I used detailed specifications as my guide to identify and correct errors in the code. The goal was to enhance the website's functionality, ensuring it performs flawlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

As I worked through the bugs in Fotomatic's design, I employed the skills I developed from studying Chrome DevTools. These tools proved invaluable for debugging—the ability to view current style values, toggle CSS rules on and off, and experiment with new rule values directly in the browser helped me effectively update and refine the site’s CSS. This practical application of Chrome DevTools was essential not only for diagnosing issues but also for seeing immediate impacts of changes, streamlining the development process.

This repository contains all my modifications and updates, demonstrating my problem-solving skills and attention to detail in web development.
